SoundcloudSDK is a framework written in Swift over Soundcloud API.

## Installation

### Swift 3.0
* CocoaPods: `pod 'Soundcloud'`
* Carthage: `github "delannoyk/SoundcloudSDK"`

### Swift 2.3
* CocoaPods: `pod 'Soundcloud', '~> 0.9.2'`
* Carthage: `github "delannoyk/SoundcloudSDK" == 0.9.2`

### Configuration

First step to use the SDK is to configure it to use your application credentials:

```swift
SoundcloudClient.clientIdentifier = "YOUR_CLIENT_IDENTIFIER"
SoundcloudClient.clientSecret  = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
SoundcloudClient.redirectURI = "YOUR_REDIRECT_URI"
```

After that, you're good to go.

## Usage

For full usage please see the [documentation](docs/).

**Examples**

You can search for tracks like this:
```swift
let queries: [SearchQueryOptions] = [
    .QueryString("The text to search"),
    .Tags(["list", "of", "tags", "to", "search", "for"]),
    .Genres(["punk", "rock", "..."]),
    .Types([TrackType.Live, TrackType.Demo])
]
Track.search(queries, completion: PaginatedAPIResponse<Track> -> Void)
```

If your client is logged in, you could favorite one of those tracks on their behalf like this:

```swift
let track: Track
track.favorite(userIdentifier: Int, completion: SimpleAPIResponse<Bool> -> Void)
```

## Example App

An example application is included in `source/SoundcloudAppTest`. Be sure to set your own SoundCloud app values in `AppDelegate`.

## Next steps

* Add unit tests
* Analyse if it's necessary to ease up things to play a file (Integrate an audio player/a dependency ?)
